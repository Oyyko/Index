Hi. This is Oyyko.

I am an undergraduate student from University of Science and Technology of China. I majored in Computer Science and Technology. I love computer science and am interested in algorithm design, computing theory, operating systems and different programming languages. My favorite language is C++, meanwhile I am familiar with python, ruby, rust, lisp. Usually I use the Linux distribution Manjaro as my daily operating system.
