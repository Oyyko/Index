### Intro

Hi. This is Oyyko.

I am an undergraduate student from the University of Science and Technology of China. I majored in Computer Science and Technology. I love computer science and am interested in algorithm design, computing theory, operating systems and different programming languages. 

Programming languages: C++, C, Python, Rust, Ruby, Javascript

OS: Manjaro Linux

Code Editor: VSCode

Laptop: ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8

### CV (verbose version)

#### Education

* **B.S. in Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Sep 2019 – July 2023 (Expected)**

#### Work experience

* **SDE Intern@Bytedance Inc, Shenzhen, China, July 2022 - August 2022**

  * Use Chromium's UI library to develop and maintain UI interfaces for multimedia services of *Lark*.
  * Fix bugs of multimedia services caused by multi-platform.
  * Add API interface to the original C++ code so that it can be called using javascript, which can be used for automated testing with js.

  

#### Awards

* Silver Medal, International College Student Programming Competition(ICPC), Nanjing, 2020.12
* Third Prize, Information Security Competition of University of Science and Technology of China, 2020.10
* Third Prize, the operating system design competition of the National College Students Computer System Ability Competition, 2021.8
  * The requirements of the competition are: design an operating system kernel for the development board of the RISC-V platform, implement the required system calls, and pass the evaluation examples. Our team implemented an operating system kernel using the Rust language. I was the captain and was responsible for writing boot initialization, process management related code, and integrating the code of the other two team members, who were responsible for writing memory management and file system code.
* Individual rank 87/3994 at Leetcode Cup 2022 Spring
* Team rank 10/3049 at Leetcode Cup 2022 Spring. You can see the competition at https://leetcode.cn/contest/season/2022-spring/. Our team name is "残酷一队"

#### Projects

* C Compiler, 2021.12
  * This project is a C compiler built using the C++ framework given by LLVM, which implements part of the C syntax. The project successfully compiles a C-like language into an LLVM intermediate form and finally into an executable file. I used flex and bison to complete the front-end design, and on the basis of carefully reading the code framework, I completed the back-end part using the knowledge I learned combined with the code framework. This is a course task.
* Jack Compiler,2021.10
  * Jack language is a programming language whose syntax is similar to JAVA's. I designed and implemented the Jack language compiler using the C++ language. Jack compiles to stack machine-oriented bytecode. So I implemented an easy bytecode executor.
* LC3 Assembler & Simulator, 2022.1
  * This project is an assembler and virtual machine for the LC3 computer. I designed and implemented both programs in C++. The assembler translates assembly language into LC3 machine code. The virtual machine can read the machine code and simulate the operation of the LC3 computer.
* MyCPU, 2021.6
  * This project is an assignment for the Principles of Computer Composition course. Using what I learned, I implemented a single-cycle CPU and a pipelined CPU in verilog, which ran successfully on an FPGA.
* kCore, 2021.8
  * This project is the winning project of the operating system design competition of the National College Students Computer System Ability Competition. The project is an operating system kernel implemented in Rust language, which draws on the design concept of Linux, and can perform functions such as memory management, process management, and file management. I am responsible for boot initialization, process management and integrating other team member's code.
* iWriter
  * just another markdown compiler implemented by C++
* GPA Compare
  * A python implementation of the millionaire problem. Used to compare the GPAs of two students without revealing specific scores.

#### Skills

* I like C++ very much and have studied it quite a bit. I am familiar with the C++20 standard and can write large programs in C++. Maybe I'm on my way to becoming a so-called language lawyer (laughs).
* I know software engineering and can design large programs using the ideas of object oriented design.
* My computer professional knowledge base is good, and I have a good grasp of computer networks, computer composition principles, operating system design, and compiler principles.
* My algorithm design ability is good. I am able to solve some algorithmic problems and apply the ideas of algorithm design in the code of actual work.

#### Club experience

* vice president, School Student Programming Association
  * The main content of work is to promote interesting algorithms and algorithm competition knowledge. Assist the team members to participate in the competition, and be responsible for the coordination and logistics. Organize an annual intramural programming competition. Develop and maintain the school's online judgement website.

#### Teaching assistant experience

* I served as a teaching assistant in the **computer programming** course, and was responsible for answering the questions of students. Also I gave a report on the C and Cpp language.
* I worked as a computer science teaching assistant on duty, and I was responsible for answering any questions about computer science from students at a fixed location every week.



#### Miscellaneous

* TOFEL score: 100
